Solutions for All Of Statistics by Wasserman

[My solutions are here](allstat.pdf)

I am doing some repetition on statistics and have chosen 'All Of Statistics' by Wasserman. I have greatly benefited from others who have shared their solutions, so I thought I could share my solutions as well. Maybe they can be of help to someone?

I have never been one for writing short, elegant proofs but instead I tend to spell things out. If you are like me, that is a good thing, and might make it easier to understand.

Please let me know if you find any mistakes/typos etc. no matter how small. I will still be grateful!

(Don't know how long this will take. It is a work in progress that I pick up when I feel like it)
